# Honey Do List for Waifu2x
This is a CLI helper for the waifu2x application available on the Mac App Store.

To use this script simply call the HDL_waifu2x.sh passing the absolute path of the videos you would like upscaled. Make the selections the program requests and your videos will be upscaled!

This script is still very early and recommendations for new features are always appreciated!
